# HTMLcssToImage

[htmlcsstoimage](https://web.archive.org/web/20240304145004/https://htmlcsstoimage.com/) is used to do a couple of things inside WPCloudDeploy:

*   Capture the home page image of a site
*   Compare before-and-after images when performing theme and plugin updates for a site

Here are links to some documentation articles that use this service:
